# Beat The Weather

Welcome to "Beat the Weather", a game that puts your memory and navigatory skills to the test!
Faced with a map of a given area, players must navigate from one end of the map to the other without 
getting caught in bad weather (either heavy rain or a thunderstorm). The game will use real maps and real, up-to-date weather forcasts.

In "Beat The Weather," players will be able to
  - play on a new, randomized map every round
  - receive visual feedback on the weather of the current location that their mouse is traversing on the map
  - record the number of consecutive rounds a player has won
  - turn off the "game" aspect of the app and just explore the entire globe with their cursor to watch for the effects surrounding different weather events

Data for both the map and weather will be obtained via public api's. The game utilizes Javascript, HTML5 and CSS.

Scripts will mainly be stored in 4 files: map.js, instructions.js, game.js & effects.js.
