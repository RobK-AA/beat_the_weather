# Beat The Weather

Welcome to "Beat the Weather", a game that puts your memory and navigatory skills to the test!

Faced with a world map, randomly centered within the United States, players must navigate to and double click on a specified state within 10 seconds and without 
getting caught in bad weather (either heavy rain or a thunderstorm). The game utilized JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3 and uses Google Maps API, LocationIQ, and OpenWeatherMap for up-to-date weather forecasts.

In "Beat The Weather," players are able to
  - play with a new, randomized series of states every round
  - receive visual feedback on navigation events, including 
    - double clicks on any area 
    - navigating to an area with "bad weather"
    - navigating to the wrong state
    - running out of time
  - record their high score and have that data persist in the web browser
